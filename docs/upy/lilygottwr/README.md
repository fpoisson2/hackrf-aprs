# LilyGo T-TWR

This port is included to provide:
- A functional example with radio (TODO)
- Demonstrate becaon mode with GPS (TODO)
- Demonstrate demod with I gate funcionality (TODO)

The LilyGo T-TWR is a commerically available dev kit including ESP32S3 + [NiceRF SA868 Wireless Transceiver](https://www.nicerf.com/walkie-talkie-module/2w-embedded-walkie-talkie-module-sa868.html).  The T-TWR comes in a few flavors, the one I've chosen is the VHF (covering APRS 144.39MHz) normal edition.  I passed on the "Open Edition" as fiddling around with this module's firmware is out of scope for this project.

In additional to processor and transceiver, the LilyGo T-TWR also includes GPS module, a screen (which I currently don't intend on implementing), and power management.
